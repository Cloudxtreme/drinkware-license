(DRINK)WARE LICENSE
===================

This is a rewrite of the beerware license by Poul-Henning Kamp that allows you to flexibly decide the drink(s) you would prefer to receive should someone meet you and want to pay you back for producing your "stuff". As this license is as close to Public Domain as you can get, only maintaining attribution, it is compatible with the GPL.

In addition to a bit of rewording, the license has been altered so that it is 80 characters in width, the resulting license fully visible in most terminal emulators without scrolling or wrapping.


The License
-----------

The blank license is visible below. To validate the license and attribute your work to you, replace (DRINK) with your choice of drink such as coffee or beer then replace the relevant parts with your own name and email.


	/* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 * "THE (DRINK)WARE LICENSE" (Rev. 1):
	 * 
	 * <your.name@email.com> 
	 * wrote this file. As long as you retain this notice you can do whatever you
	 * want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is
	 * worth it, you can buy me the above drink(s) in return.
	 *
	 * Your Name
